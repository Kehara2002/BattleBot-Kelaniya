# Overview  
This project is a custom-built battle robot featuring a high speed grinder mechanism and an ESP32-based wireless control system.  A custom ESP32 radio controller communicates with the robot via custom made RF Module, enabling forward, backward, turning, and start grinder commands 
ith minimal latency. The build integrates mechanical design, embedded programming, and motor control for a complete hands-on robotics experience.
